#### Tile 5: Iconic Core (Anchor)

The heart of the city. Tall towers, recognisable skyline, cathedral or landmark. Sun partially visible through haze. It defines peak contrast, warmth, and atmosphere for the entire panorama.

- **Density:** Ultra High
- **Form:** Maximum verticality
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - One primary vertical urban axis must visually dominate the composition. Secondary diagonals or crossings, if present, must remain clearly subordinate and partially obscured.
  - Tallest towers
  - Recognizable skyline silhouette
  - **Framing lock:** skyline mass should occupy a large vertical share of the frame; avoid excess sky
  - If the solar disk is visible, it may be **partially cropped by the top edge**; do not lift framing to fit it
  - The vertical core towers should reach near the upper frame boundary; core must feel like the **maximum vertical pressure** reference for the panorama
  - Solar disk diffused and partially obscured by haze, without hard edge
  - Sun scale may exceed the frame and may be partially cropped.
  - Emphasis is achieved through scale and brightness, not vertical recentering.
  - Skyline height must match the global horizon reference.
  - Major avenue or urban valley
  - centered / frontal diffusion of light
  - traffic: strong axial flow
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Industrial decay
  - Nature dominance, rural elements
  - Heavy industry
