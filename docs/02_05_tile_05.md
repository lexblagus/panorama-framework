#### Tile 5: Iconic Core (Anchor)

The heart of the city. Tall towers, recognisable skyline, cathedral or landmark. Sun partially visible through haze. It defines peak contrast, warmth, and atmosphere for the entire panorama.

- **Density:** Ultra High
- **Form:** Maximum verticality
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - One primary vertical urban axis must visually dominate the composition. Secondary diagonals or crossings, if present, must remain clearly subordinate and partially obscured.
  - Tallest towers
  - Recognizable skyline silhouette
  - **Framing stability authority (Tile 5 is the ruler):**
    - Establish the shared vanishing-height feel and vertical “pressure” for all tiles; maintain telephoto compression and disciplined sky budget.
    - Do **not** vertically recenter to fit the sun or towers; cropping/clipping is preferred if elements press the frame.
    - If framing reads too open, add skyline mass, stacked midground slabs, or haze inside the distance volume instead of lifting framing. Prevent push-in reads by avoiding a single near-field avenue/interchange filling the bottom; rely on midground layering.
  - **FOV clamp:** rectilinear, strong telephoto compression, **narrow field of view**; forbid wide-angle drift or zoom-out framing.
  - The vertical core towers should reach near the upper frame boundary; core must feel like the **maximum vertical pressure** reference for the panorama.
  - Solar disk diffused and partially obscured by haze, without hard edge. The disk may be unnaturally large, **partially cropped** by the frame; do not lift framing to fit it.
  - Emphasis is achieved through scale and brightness, not vertical recentering.
  - Skyline height must match the global horizon reference.
  - Major avenue or urban valley
  - centered / frontal diffusion of light
  - traffic: strong axial flow
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Industrial decay
  - Nature dominance, rural elements
  - Heavy industry

## Active Calibration Layer

- **Framing stability (Tile 5 as ruler):**
  - Lock the shared vanishing-height read and vertical pressure for all tiles; no independent up/down pitch.
  - Cropping/clipping sun or tower tips is acceptable; never lift framing or widen FOV to fit them.
  - If sky feels too open, add skyline mass, stacked midground slabs, or haze inside the same framing. If the read feels push-in, reduce near-field dominance and add depth via midground stacking/overlap.
- **Enforcement rule (Tile 5 specific):**
  - Tile 5 must not read “lower” than Tiles 3/7; correct by adding mass and density, not sky.
  - Reject any framing that widens FOV or reduces apparent tower height relative to Tiles 3 and 7.

## Tile 9 deviation reference

Purpose: generate a reproducible “deviation reference” image derived from Tile 5 that captures:
- extreme blue–gray milky haze behavior (distance collapse without full whiteout)
- subtle, sparse light accents that read *through* haze (to prevent flatness)
- without changing Tile 5 geometry, framing, or composition

Workflow:
1) Generate Tile 5 normally using its locked prompt/specs (canonical Tile 5 output).
2) Run the “Tile 9 deviation prompt (hard haze)” as an *edit* on that Tile 5 output (geometry locked).
3) Save the result as the dedicated reference image to be provided to Tile 9 generation.

Rules for the deviation reference:
- Geometry lock is absolute: do not move or add structures, do not change framing, do not open sky.
- Atmosphere is the priority: push haze very hard (milky white/blue-gray canopy), but keep the near/midground barely legible.
- Add only sparse light accents for color contrast (not nightlife): a few warm window glows, a few warm street/utility lights, and faint vehicle lights if applicable.
- Accents must be diffused by haze and low intensity: no “city sparkle” fields, no neon, no dramatic contrast boosts.
