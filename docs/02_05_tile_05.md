#### Tile 5: Iconic Core (Anchor)

The heart of the city. Tall towers, recognisable skyline, cathedral or landmark. Sun partially visible through haze. It defines peak contrast, warmth, and atmosphere for the entire panorama.

- **Density:** Ultra High
- **Form:** Maximum verticality
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - One primary vertical urban axis must visually dominate the composition. Secondary diagonals or crossings, if present, must remain clearly subordinate and partially obscured.
  - Tallest towers
  - Recognizable skyline silhouette
  - **Framing lock (Three-Band authority):**
    - **Horizon band (Band A):** set the panorama’s reference horizon/vanishing height here; keep the horizon and diffused solar glare within the top ~20–22% of the frame; no vertical recentering to fit the sun.
    - **Crest band (Band B):** skyline/tower peaks dissolve in haze just below Band A; no crest touches the top edge; skyline mass should occupy the upper third, minimizing sky.
    - **Foreground cap (Band C):** reserve the bottom ~12% for the axial avenue/rail read; no clipping at the bottom edge; side edges remain stitch-safe.
  - **FOV clamp:** rectilinear, strong telephoto compression, **narrow field of view**; forbid wide-angle drift or zoom-out framing.
  - The vertical core towers should reach near the upper frame boundary; core must feel like the **maximum vertical pressure** reference for the panorama.
  - Solar disk diffused and partially obscured by haze, without hard edge. The disk may be unnaturally large, **partially cropped** by the frame; do not lift framing to fit it.
  - Emphasis is achieved through scale and brightness, not vertical recentering.
  - Skyline height must match the global horizon reference.
  - Major avenue or urban valley
  - centered / frontal diffusion of light
  - traffic: strong axial flow
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Industrial decay
  - Nature dominance, rural elements
  - Heavy industry

## Active Calibration Layer

- **Tile 5 defines the vertical rulers (Three-Band Lock authority):**
  - Band A: set the reference horizon/vanishing height here (top ~20–22%).
  - Band B: set the reference crest height here (tower envelope dissolving just below Band A).
  - Band C: set the reference foreground cap here (bottom ~12%).
- **Enforcement rule (Tile 5 specific):**
  - If the diffused solar disk appears, it may be partially cropped; do not lift framing to fit it.
  - Avoid excess sky; Tile 5 must never read “lower” than Tile 3/7 due to sky share drift.
  - Reject any framing that widens FOV or reduces apparent tower height relative to Tiles 3 and 7.
