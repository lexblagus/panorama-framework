#### Tile 9: Heavy Industrial Expanse

Dense but industrial. Smokestacks, cargo lines, heavy machinery. City dissolves into haze.

- **Density:** Ultra High (infrastructure density)
- **Form:** Heavy industry. Heaviest infrastructure dissolving into haze, biased toward center and right half of frame.
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - Diffuse industrial glow interacting with fog, producing soft volumetric radiance without increasing contrast or warmth.
  - Land–water boundary must read as an engineered, industrial shoreline: predominantly straight, angular, and artificial, formed by docks, harbors, and containment structures. Organic, eroded, or natural coastlines are not allowed. The boundary should introduce a strong diagonal or faceted geometry that contrasts with the lateral flow of the panorama.
  - Factories
  - Major industries
  - Petrochemicals
  - Chimneys
  - Rail complexity
  - Large cargo ships
  - Distant smog
  - light coming from the left
  - Wind direction to right (affecting chimney smoke)
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Nature
  - Landmark buildings
  - Clear skyline edges must dissolve into haze
  - Residential streets
  - Sun prohibited (see _Global Constraints / Lighting_).
