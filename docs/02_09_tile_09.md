#### Tile 9: Heavy Industrial Expanse

Dense but industrial. Smokestacks, cargo lines, heavy machinery. City dissolves into haze.

- **Density:** Ultra High (infrastructure density)
- **Form:** Heavy industry. Heaviest infrastructure dissolving into haze, biased toward center and right half of frame.
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - Diffuse industrial glow interacting with fog, producing soft volumetric radiance without increasing contrast or warmth.
  - Land–water boundary must read as an engineered, industrial shoreline: predominantly straight, angular, and artificial, formed by docks, harbors, and containment structures. Organic, eroded, or natural coastlines are not allowed. The boundary should introduce a strong diagonal or faceted geometry that contrasts with the lateral flow of the panorama.
  - Factories
  - Major industries
  - Petrochemicals
  - Chimneys
  - Rail complexity
  - Large cargo ships
  - Distant smog
  - **Maximum haze mandate:** Tile 9 must exhibit the strongest atmospheric density in the panorama
  - Visibility collapse: far background should be **nearly erased** into milky smog; skyline edges must not be crisp
  - Haze may glow softly (volumetric radiance) but **must not** increase contrast or warmth
  - Light-direction enforcement: key light from the **left**; primary cast shadows fall to the **right**
  - light coming from the left
  - Wind direction to right (affecting chimney smoke)
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Nature
  - Landmark buildings
  - Clear skyline edges must dissolve into haze
  - Residential streets
  - Sun prohibited (see _Global Constraints / Lighting_).

## Active Calibration Layer

- **Three-band framing lock (Tile 5 referenced):**
  - Band A: align the *vanishing height* of rail/road/roof-fields with Tile 5’s horizon baseline (true horizon may be erased by smog) and permit a **larger sky band (~24–30%)**.
  - Band B: keep the dominant mass crest consistent below the expanded sky band; do not shrink the industrial envelope even with more sky.
  - Band C: prevent push-in reads — no single foreground yard/track fan fills the bottom; emphasize layered repetition into depth.
- **Maximum haze mandate enforcement:**
  - Far background should collapse into milky smog; skyline edges must not be crisp.
  - Increase haze by thickening atmospheric particulate and volumetric diffusion over distance; expanded sky share is already allowed via Band A.
