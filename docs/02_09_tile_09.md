# Tile 9: Heavy Industrial Expanse

Dense but industrial. Smokestacks, cargo lines, heavy machinery. City dissolves into haze.

- **Density:** Ultra High (infrastructure density)
- **Form:** Heavy industry. Heaviest infrastructure dissolving into haze, biased toward center and right half of frame.
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **Key Elements**
  - Diffuse industrial glow interacting with fog, producing soft volumetric radiance without increasing contrast or warmth.
  - Land–water boundary must read as an engineered, industrial shoreline: predominantly straight, angular, and artificial, formed by docks, harbors, and containment structures. Organic, eroded, or natural coastlines are not allowed. The boundary should introduce a strong diagonal or faceted geometry that contrasts with the lateral flow of the panorama.
  - Factories
  - Major industries
  - Petrochemicals
  - Chimneys
  - Rail complexity
  - Large cargo ships
  - Distant smog
  - **Maximum haze mandate:** Tile 9 must exhibit the strongest atmospheric density in the panorama
  - Visibility collapse: far background should be **nearly erased** into milky smog; skyline edges must not be crisp
  - Haze may glow softly (volumetric radiance) but **must not** increase contrast or warmth
  - Light-direction enforcement: key light from the **left**; primary cast shadows fall to the **right**
  - light coming from the left
  - Wind direction to right (affecting chimney smoke)
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Nature
  - Landmark buildings
  - Clear skyline edges must dissolve into haze
  - Residential streets
  - Sun prohibited (see _Global Constraints / Lighting_).

## References

Tile 9 may be generated using two reference images. References are conditioning inputs only; they must not be copied as content.

- **Reference A (Ruler): Tile 5 ruler image**
  - **Transfer allowed:** camera/framing physics (horizon/vanishing-height read), telephoto compression feel, vertical “pressure”, sky-budget discipline (do not open sky), midground scale.
  - **Transfer forbidden:** any Tile 5 content identity (no skyline motifs, no landmark silhouettes, no central-axis logic, no sun disk).

- **Reference B (Mood): Past Tile 9 generated mood reference**
  - **Transfer allowed:** haze thickness/physics and distance-collapse behavior, bluish-gray palette under smog, edge softness/contrast rolloff, and how sparse utilitarian lights bloom through haze.
  - **Transfer forbidden:** layout/composition copying (no shoreline geometry cloning, no repeating ship placement, no duplicating corridor shapes), no time-of-day shift (must remain daytime), no light-direction change.

- **Precedence**
  - If both references are provided: **Reference A controls framing**, **Reference B controls atmosphere and light-bloom language**.
  - If any reference conflicts with `docs/01_core_canonical.md` or this tile spec (light direction, sun prohibition, wind direction, maximum haze mandate), the reference must be ignored for that attribute.

- **Suggested upload order:** Reference A, then Reference B.

## Generation Passes

Tile 9 is generated in **two passes** for quality and control. Each pass compiles to a separate prompt.

### Pass 1 — Ruler Pass (Framing Lock)
- **Uploads / Inputs:**
  - Reference A (Tile 5 ruler) — REQUIRED
- **Transfer allowed (from Ref A):**
  - camera/framing physics, telephoto compression feel, sky-budget discipline, midground scale
- **Transfer forbidden (from Ref A):**
  - any Tile 5 content identity (no skyline motifs, no landmark silhouettes, no sun disk)
- **Primary objective:** lock framing + scale + industrial shoreline / port massing consistent with Tile 9 spec
- **Output artifact:** `tile-09_pass-1` (used as base for Pass 2)

### Pass 2 — Mood Pass (Atmosphere Lock)
- **Uploads / Inputs:**
  - Pass 1 output (`tile-09_pass-1`) — REQUIRED (base image)
  - Reference B (past Tile 9 mood reference) — REQUIRED
- **Must preserve (locked from Pass 1):**
  - framing, horizon/vanishing-height read, shoreline geometry class, major massing placement
- **Transfer allowed (from Ref B):**
  - haze thickness/physics, distance-collapse behavior, bluish-gray smog palette, contrast rolloff, sparse utilitarian light bloom behavior
- **Transfer forbidden (from Ref B):**
  - composition/layout copying, repeating ship placement, time-of-day shift, light-direction change
- **Primary objective:** enforce “maximum haze mandate” + utilitarian light bloom language without moving geometry
- **Final output artifact:** `tile-09_final`

## Active Calibration Layer

- **Framing stability (Tile 5 as ruler):**
  - Treat vertical drift as camera pitch drift; do not vertically recenter to fit smokestacks or sun.
  - If the true horizon is erased by smog, use rail/road/roof-field vanishing height as the shared horizon proxy; keep pitch consistent with Tile 5.
  - Crop/clip when elements pressure the top. If sky feels too open, add industrial mass, stacked midground infrastructure, or haze inside the distance volume—do **not** open more sky.
  - Prevent push-in reads by avoiding a single foreground yard/track fan; reduce near-field dominance and emphasize layered repetition into depth.
- **Maximum haze mandate enforcement:**
  - Far background should collapse into milky smog; skyline edges must not be crisp.
  - Increase haze by thickening atmospheric particulate and volumetric diffusion over distance.
- **Hard haze**
  - Light accents: sparse utilitarian lights visible through haze (dock/work lights, obstruction beacons, occasional warm window glows, faint vehicle lights if present). Explicitly forbid city-sparkle/nightlife.
