#### Tile 1: Nature as Dominant Chaos

This tile represents the **natural extreme** of the panorama, where terrain, geology, and water remain dominant and only partially negotiable by human presence. Nature is not pastoral or calming here; it is **energetic, vertical, and resistant**. Human occupation exists, but only through adaptation, privilege, and risk.

Mountains, steep hills, cliffs, and rugged terrain define the composition, with elevation changes and exposed rock shaping all movement and construction. A river or reservoir forms a primary structural spine, often interacting aggressively with terrain through cascades, stepped flow, or waterfalls. Infrastructure appears as **cuts, scars, and insertions**, not as organizing grids.

Urban logic is absent. There is no skyline, no axial planning, and no sense of metropolitan order. The city does not dissolve gently into nature; instead, **nature overwhelms and constrains human systems**.

- **Density:** Very low
- **Form:** Terrain-dominant, mountainous, vertically aggressive
- **Atmosphere:** Clear, crisp daylight with strong material definition; reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression
- **__Key Elements__**
  - Mountains, steep hills, cliffs, exposed rock
  - River or reservoir acting as a central natural spine
  - Cascades, waterfalls, spillways, or dams integrated into terrain
  - Dense, irregular vegetation with high variety
  - Roads carved into rock, tunnels, viaducts, switchbacks
  - Sparse, elevated settlements embedded into slopes
  - Strong architectural heterogeneity (vernacular houses, stone dwellings, brutalist or modern hillside villas)
  - Optional subtle passenger rail elements (tunnels or constrained corridors)
  - Vertical access systems where terrain is extreme (funiculars, cable systems, or cliff elevators), strictly subordinate
  - Increase midground human presence for scale continuity: multiple slope settlements + proto-infrastructure cuts (roads/viaducts/tunnels) visible in layered pockets; still non-urban and non-grid
  - Light originating from the **far right**, off-frame (see _Core Canonical → Global Constraints → Lighting_); primary cast shadows fall to the **left**
- **__Forbidden Motifs__**
  - Skylines or distant megacity silhouettes
  - High-rises or skyscrapers
  - Urban grids or major avenues
  - Pastoral or idyllic countryside imagery
  - Sun disk or visible solar source (see _Global Constraints / Lighting_)
  - Flat or gently rolling suburban landscapes

## Active Calibration Layer

- **Three-band framing lock (Tile 5 referenced):**
  - Match Tile 5’s **Band A** (horizon/vanishing height proxy) as closely as terrain allows.
  - Keep the terrain crest within the shared **Band B** envelope; peaks may intrude slightly higher **without increasing total sky share**.
  - Respect **Band C**: avoid a single giant near-foreground cliff/road mass filling the bottom; prefer layered midground settlements + infrastructure traces.
