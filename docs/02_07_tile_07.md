#### Tile 7: Urban Sprawl

This is the release of vertical pressure after the urban core. The city remains dense and active, but height dominance diminishes. Towers thin out, skylines fragment, and the urban mass spreads laterally rather than stacking upward.

This is not suburbia. Density remains high, but expressed through crowded mid-rise fabric, infrastructural clutter, and circulation sprawl rather than vertical monumentality. The city feels older, heavier, and more negotiated.

Architecture is mixed-era and visually noisy. Aging residential blocks, commercial slabs, and older office buildings dominate. New construction appears opportunistic rather than planned. No building asserts iconic identity.

Circulation becomes broad and logistics-aware. Roads widen, intersections grow complex, and traffic shifts toward directional movement rather than axial flow. Early logistics vehicles and service trucks appear, but full industrial systems are still absent.

Atmosphere continues the lateral decline from the core. Warmth fades, contrast drops, and haze thickens noticeably, desaturating color and softening distance. The skyline dissolves unevenly into atmospheric mass.

- **Density:** Medium–High (horizontal dominance)
- **Form:** Crowded, lower-rise urban fabric
- **Atmosphere:** reflects the **lateral ambiance gradient** appropriate to this tile’s position and must not contradict the global progression. Desaturated warmth, thickening haze
- **Light direction:** From the left
- **Key Elements**
  - Dense mid-rise residential and commercial buildings
  - Aging infrastructure and visible retrofits
  - Broad roads, layered intersections, overpasses
  - Visual clutter: signage, rooftop equipment, patched façades
  - Increased presence of trucks and service vehicles
- **Forbidden Motifs**
  - Sun prohibited (see _Global Constraints / Lighting_).
  - Iconic buildings or skyline silhouettes
  - Clear vertical axis or monumental avenues
  - Heavy industry or large-scale logistics hubs
