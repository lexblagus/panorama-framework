# Tile 7: Logistics Transition Zone

## Canonical Human Spec

### Description

Tile 7 represents a **late-stage urban district transitioning toward logistics and service dominance**, situated between the dense urban core and the fully industrial periphery. The city supports a **large resident population**, but residential life is increasingly compressed and subordinated to circulation, commerce, and utility systems.

This is **not suburbia** and not a residential neighborhood. The city feels older, heavier, and negotiated, shaped by throughput rather than comfort.

### Role

- Acts as the **threshold between dense urban life and industrial systems**
- Signals the shift from residential/commercial priority to **logistics-driven urban form**
- Introduces population mass without urban centrality
- Prepares the perceptual and semantic transition toward Tile 9

### Density & Form

- High density achieved through **large-scale aggregation and infrastructure layering**
- Predominantly low-rise to mid-rise construction
- Emphasis on **large footprints and repeated masses**, not vertical landmarks
- Urban fabric feels compressed, aged, and service-oriented
- Perceived scale emerges through population mass and circulation depth

### Key Elements

- **Large residential blocks**:
  - extensive, repetitive housing structures
  - working-class in character
  - non-iconic, population-oriented
- Residential blocks interwoven with infrastructure:
  - roads and ramps cutting through housing clusters
  - buildings wrapped around circulation and utilities
- Broad, load-bearing roads with layered intersections
- Multi-level circulation:
  - surface streets
  - elevated roads and flyovers
  - ramps and partial interchanges
  - occasional tunnel entrances and underpasses
- Early logistics and service traffic:
  - rigid multi-axle trucks
  - urban cargo vehicles
  - articulated trucks and semi-trailers (present but not dominant)
  - fuel and gas tanker trucks
  - cab-over and non-cab-over configurations
  - canvas-tarp truck bodies in muted orange and brown tones, new and weathered
- Low-rise commercial slabs, warehouses, and service buildings
- City utilities embedded in the fabric:
  - gas pipelines
  - water backbone infrastructure
  - service corridors and utility installations

### Forbidden Motifs

- Suburban residential patterns
- Scenic or landscaped housing environments
- Iconic skylines or landmark architecture
- Full industrial systems (ports, refineries, container yards)
- Clean, master-planned urban order
- Pedestrian-centric urban design
- Isolated or self-contained residential neighborhoods

## Prompt Core (Invariant)

- Photorealistic aerial perspective
- Portrait orientation
- Fixed elevated camera position
- Rectilinear optics
- Strong telephoto-like depth compression
- Unified camera system consistent across all tiles
- Golden hour lighting
- Sun not visible in frame
- No wide-angle distortion
- No stylistic filters or illustration aesthetics

## Active Calibration Layer (Anchored)

- Residential mass must be **large-scale and repetitive**
- Housing must read as **population support**, not neighborhood identity
- Logistics and service systems must drive spatial organization
- Vehicle diversity preferred over vehicle volume
- Full industrial dominance must remain absent
- **Directional continuity (post-core release):**
  - dominant spatial energy should read as **diagonal bottom-left → top-right**
  - expressed through mass orientation and circulation layering, not cinematic tilt
- **Framing + scale discipline (fix “too zoomed in” reads):**
  - avoid a single near-foreground interchange filling the bottom of frame
  - roads may dominate, but must remain **telephoto-compressed** and not “close-up”
  - increase **midground stacking**: residential slabs + warehouses + service yards overlapping in layers
- **Light-direction enforcement for Tiles 6–9:**
  - key light from the **left** (off-frame)
  - primary cast shadows fall to the **right**
  - brightest haze/sky pressure should sit on the **left side**, not the right
