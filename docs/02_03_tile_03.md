#### Tile 3: Transition Zone

##### Canonical Human Spec (Conceptual Authority)

Tile 3 represents the first true urban transition, where residential density gives way to mixed-use complexity and early vertical ambition. The city begins to assert structural order, but without iconic dominance.

Architecture diversifies in height, age, and function. Taller residential blocks and early office buildings emerge, but remain subordinate to the overall mass. No skyline silhouette is permitted; verticality is suggestive, not declarative.

Circulation becomes more complex. Roads curve and overlap, introducing diagonal movement from bottom-right to top-left, consistent with the panorama’s camera flow. Overpasses, ramps, and early multi-level intersections appear, but without the axial clarity of the core.

Proto-infrastructure gives way to coordinated systems: subway entrances, cut-and-cover tunnels, and early elevated segments begin to appear, reinforcing density without industrial repetition.

Atmosphere marks the first clear warm shift in the panorama. Early amber tones appear, and a light haze begins to soften distance while preserving foreground clarity. The sun itself remains invisible.

* **Density:** Medium–High
* **Form:** Residential → mixed-use transition
* **Atmosphere:** Early warmth, first haze accumulation
* **Light direction:** From the right

**Key Elements**

* Taller residential blocks (10–25 floors), mixed with mid-rise housing
* Early office buildings without landmark identity
* Overpasses, ramps, subway entrances, shallow tunnels
* Increased traffic density and circulation overlap
* Optional single stadium, cropped or partially obscured, never centered

**Forbidden Motifs**

* Sun visible
* Iconic skyline or recognizable city markers
* Central vertical axis or S-shaped avenue
* Symmetrical boulevards or grid dominance

##### Prompt Core (Invariant / Locked)

This section defines **what must not change** unless the tile is fundamentally redefined.

* Fixed elevated aerial viewpoint
* Rectilinear optics
* Strong telephoto-like depth compression
* Shared camera height, pitch, and horizon physics with all other tiles
* Golden hour lighting
* Light originating from the right
* No visible solar disk
* Tile identity: *pre-core, non-iconic, transitional*

This block is **conceptually locked** and may only be altered if the tile’s role in the panorama changes.

##### Active Calibration Layer

###### Pass 1: Spatial Force Rotation (Mutable)

**Purpose:**
Introduce diagonal dominance through occlusion and overlap **without altering scale, height, or atmosphere**.

**Allowed to affect**

* Occlusion density
* Midground stacking
* Diagonal visual pull

**Must NOT affect**

* Building height ranges
* Camera framing or optics
* Atmospheric warmth or haze level
* Tile role (must remain pre-core)

**Calibration directives**

* Increase midground density through layered overlap.
* Buildings should partially block one another across depth.
* Streets, overpasses, and building volumes must reinforce a bottom-right → top-left diagonal read.
* Reduce perceived openness by limiting sky exposure via overlap, not height.

###### Pass 2: Horizon & Skyline Normalization**

**Purpose**
Normalize perceived horizon height and skyline physics relative to Tile 5, reducing the “zoomed / enlarged” reading of Tile 3 **without altering spatial force rotation, scale, or camera parameters**.

**Allowed to affect**

* Far-background stacking density
* Depth-layer count above midground mass
* Horizon dissolution behavior
* Sky share through background layering (not cropping)

**Must NOT affect**

* Camera height, pitch, or optics
* Telephoto compression strength
* Diagonal dominance established in Pass-1
* Building height ranges
* Atmospheric warmth or haze intensity
* Semantic role (must remain transitional, pre-core)

**Calibration directives**

* Increase the number of **distant background layers** beyond the midground, including:

  * softened building silhouettes,
  * faint infrastructural traces,
  * compressed urban mass dissolving into haze.
* Ensure that the **visual horizon sits at the same perceptual height** as Tile 5 by:

  * allowing far structures to fade gradually rather than terminating sharply,
  * avoiding clear skyline edges.
* Reduce the sense of “foreground authority” by:

  * letting background mass compete gently for attention through repetition and compression,
  * maintaining occlusion density while extending depth.
* Preserve existing diagonal pull and midground overlap established in Pass-1.
* Sky visibility may be reduced **only through added depth and atmospheric layering**, never by vertical reframing.

**Success condition**

* Tile 3 no longer reads as “closer” or “shot tighter” than adjacent tiles.
* The skyline feels continuous with Tile 5, though lower and less iconic.
* The tile still clearly reads as transitional, not core-adjacent.

###### Pass 3b: Vertical Density Falloff Calibration (Provisional)

**Status**
- Active
- Provisional
- Direction validated, not yet converged

**Purpose**

Reduce the residual “zoomed / closer camera” perception in Tile 3 by accelerating **vertical density falloff toward the upper third of the frame**, without altering camera parameters, spatial force rotation, horizon physics, or atmosphere.

This pass replaces the previous Pass 3 (Foreground Authority), which was found insufficient on its own.

**Allowed to affect**

- Vertical continuity of urban mass above the midground
- Rate of upward dissolution into haze
- Fragmentation and thinning of upper building volumes
- Perceptual breathing room above the midground layer

**Must NOT affect**

- Camera height, pitch, or optics
- Telephoto compression strength
- Diagonal dominance established in Pass 1
- Horizon alignment established in Pass 2
- Midground density and overlap
- Building height ranges (no lowering or truncation)
- Atmospheric warmth, haze color, or overall luminance
- Semantic role of the tile (must remain transitional and pre-core)

**Calibration directives**

- Accelerate vertical mass decay above the midground:
  - upper portions of buildings should soften, fragment, and dissolve earlier,
  - continuous vertical walls must not persist into the upper third of the frame.
- Ensure that Tile 3 exhibits **earlier upward release** than Tile 5:
  - vertical pressure should peak lower and dissipate faster.
- Preserve strong midground density and diagonal compression:
  - the city must still feel heavy and compressed at eye level.
- Introduce perceptual “air” above the midground through thinning and haze takeover,
  - without increasing visible sky area or changing framing.

**Current evaluation**

- Effect is visible and directionally correct.
- Vertical wall sensation is reduced but still present.
- Additional strengthening of upward falloff is required.

**Next action (planned)**

- Re-run Pass 3b with increased upward thinning intensity,
  - without touching any other calibration layers.
