# Tile 3: Transition Zone

## Canonical Human Spec

**Description**

Tile 3 depicts a **transitional urban system** situated between the natural dominance of Tile 1 and the cosmopolitan vertical intensity of Tile 5.  
It is a city that still **integrates nature and human-scale life**, but where urban density and infrastructural complexity are clearly asserting control.

This is not an edge condition and not a pre-core skyline.  
It is an **inhabited, mixed, green-interwoven city fabric** where nature survives *inside* the city rather than outside it.

**Role**

- Acts as the **perceptual and semantic bridge** between:
  - Tile 1 (nature-dominant chaos)
  - Tile 5 (cosmopolitan megacity core)
- Establishes **urban complexity without monumentality**
- Introduces **green urbanism and human-scale signals** before vertical pressure escalates
- Normalizes scale for the panorama by providing a mid-density reference

**Density & Form**

- Dense, continuous urban fabric
- Predominantly **low- to mid-rise** construction
- Vertical ambition is restrained; density is achieved through:
  - accumulation
  - heterogeneity
  - overlap
- Urban form is **irregular, lived-in, and layered**
- Nature is **interwoven**, not separated or scenic

**Key Elements**

- Canalized stream or river remnant  
  (concrete channel with softened, vegetated edges; non-heroic)
- Interwoven green urbanism:
  - trees within blocks
  - planted medians
  - weedy vegetation along infrastructure
- Mixed residential fabric:
  - mid-rise apartment blocks
  - smaller residential houses
  - heterogeneous building ages and styles
- Human-scale circulation:
  - pedestrian stairways
  - footbridges
  - small overpasses
- Neighborhood commerce:
  - market strips
  - corner shops
  - small ground-floor retail
- Rooftop life:
  - water tanks
  - laundry lines
  - small rooftop structures
- Pocket parks and courtyards (subtle, secondary)
- Embedded transit:
  - small subway entrances
  - short elevated rail segments
  - non-monumental stations

**Forbidden Motifs**

- Iconic skyline silhouettes
- Landmark towers or heroic vertical forms
- Large scenic parks or landscaped masterplans
- Stadiums or civic megastructures
- Purely residential suburbia
- Purely infrastructural dominance (belongs to Tile 7)
- Pristine or untouched nature (belongs to Tile 1)


## Prompt Core (Locked)

- Photorealistic aerial perspective
- Portrait orientation
- Fixed elevated camera position
- Rectilinear optics
- Strong telephoto-like depth compression
- Unified camera system consistent with all tiles
- Golden hour lighting
- Sun not visible in frame
- No tilt-shift, no wide-angle distortion
- No stylistic filters or illustration aesthetics

This prompt core is **invariant** and must not be altered during tile-specific calibration.

## Active Calibration Layer

- Enforce **interwoven green urbanism**:
  - greenery must appear inside the city fabric, not only at edges
- Maintain **human-scale readability**:
  - vehicles, shops, stairs, rooftops must act as scale references
- Balance density without vertical escalation:
  - crowding through variety and overlap, not height
  - **no distant high-rise skyline band**; any taller elements must remain small, rare, and subordinate
- **Directional continuity (subtle):**
  - maintain a weak diagonal tendency **bottom-right → top-left** without forming a dominant axis
- Ensure the tile reads as:
  - denser and more complex than Tile 1
  - clearly less monumental than Tile 5
- Avoid perceptual drift toward:
  - suburban calm
  - skyline formation
  - infrastructural dominance
- **Framing stability (Tile 5 as ruler):**
  - Treat vertical drift as camera pitch drift; never vertically recenter to fit crest or subject.
  - Crop/clip if needed; maintain Tile 5’s telephoto framing pressure.
  - If sky feels too open, add roof-field mass, stacked midground slabs, and haze inside the distance volume—do **not** open more sky.
  - Prevent push-in reads by reducing single near-foreground dominance and adding depth via midground stacking, overlap, and occlusion; keep any roof-field crest subordinate (no skyline silhouette).
- **Scale reinforcement (to stabilize crest without adding high-rises):**
  - Increase repetition of mid-rise slabs, roof clutter, and layered infrastructure so the city mass occupies more of the frame **without becoming a skyline**.

This layer is subject to refinement as generation behavior evolves,  
but must always respect the Canonical Human Spec.
