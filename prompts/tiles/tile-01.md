# Tile 1: Generator prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image depicting the **natural extreme** of the panorama: steep mountains, cliffs, rugged terrain, and a deep valley carved by a river or reservoir. Captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system. Broad coverage, compressed distance, no wide-angle distortion.
>
> Nature is **dominant, energetic, and resistant**, not pastoral. Exposed rock faces, sharp elevation drops, dense irregular vegetation, and turbulent water behavior (cascades, stepped flow, waterfalls, spillways, or a dam integrated into terrain) define the scene.
>
> Human presence exists only as **negotiated proto-infrastructure**: carved mountain roads, switchbacks, tunnels, viaducts, cliffside cuts, retaining walls, and small access structures. Settlements are sparse but legible in **layered pockets**: hillside dwellings, terraces, and scattered slope villages embedded into the terrain (vernacular houses, stone dwellings, occasional brutalist or modern hillside villas). Optional subtle passenger rail may appear as a constrained corridor or tunnel segment, strictly subordinate.
>
> **Three-band framing lock (Tile 5 referenced):** keep vertical framing consistent with the panorama. Lower Band A slightly to allow **~24–30% sky** while keeping the shared vanishing logic. Peaks sit below the expanded sky band and dissolve in haze; no crest touches the top edge. Avoid a single near-foreground cliff/road mass filling the bottom; prefer midground stacking and layered settlement pockets.
>
> The **dominant light pressure originates from the far right edge of the frame**, fully off-image. The sun is not visible. Primary cast shadows fall to the **left**. Air is clear and crisp relative to later tiles, with strong material definition and minimal haze.
>
> No skyline, no metropolitan order, no urban grids or major avenues. The scene must read as **nature overwhelming human systems**, forming the leftmost anchor of the panorama.

> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
