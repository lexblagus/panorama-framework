# Tile 5: Locked prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented image of the **iconic urban core** of a vast megacity at **golden hour**, captured from a fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**. Use a **narrow field of view** (no wide-angle drift); the city appears monumentally dense, vertically stacked, and compressed toward the horizon.
>
> A **single, perfectly vertical primary urban axis** dominates the composition, running from the bottom of the frame toward the distant skyline. This axis acts as the gravitational spine of the city. All other circulation elements remain subordinate and partially obscured.
>
> **Layered infrastructure aligns with this axis**: a grand avenue at street level, rail or subway corridors below, and occasional elevated infrastructure above. Rail lines run vertically or near-vertically and may enter or exit tunnels, with trains appearing only in partial segments. The rail corridor defines scale through repetition and layering, not bulk.
>
> The skyline reaches its **maximum vertical intensity** here, with dense clusters of tall towers. Architectural variety is intentionally heterogeneous: modern glass slabs, stepped art-deco silhouettes, neo-gothic verticals, brutalist concrete masses, and dense mid-rise blocks coexist. Architectural relatives, not twins.
>
> **Three-band framing lock authority:** Tile 5 defines the panorama’s vertical rulers. **Horizon band (Band A):** keep horizon/vanishing height and diffused solar glare in the top ~20–22% of the frame; do not lift framing to fit the sun. **Crest band (Band B):** skyline/tower peaks dissolve in haze just below Band A; no crest touches the top edge; skyline mass occupies the upper third with minimal sky. **Foreground cap (Band C):** bottom ~12% reserved for the axial avenue/rail read; no clipping at the bottom edge; side edges stay stitch-safe.
>
> Lighting is **centered / frontal diffusion**, producing maximum atmospheric diffusion without harsh contrast. The solar disk may be **partially visible only here**, fully diffused through haze with no hard edge; it may read unnaturally large and may be partially cropped. Shadows are minimal / symmetric and must not imply a strong left/right key.
>
> **Contrast follows depth.** Foreground retains higher local contrast and clearer material definition; midground softens under warm haze; background dissolves into amber atmospheric diffusion near the horizon.
>
> Surfaces show subtle wear and imperfection: aging concrete, weathered stone, uneven glass reflections, rooftop clutter. No hyper-clean finishes, no artificial polish, no crystalline artifacts.
>
> The image must read as the **equilibrium point of the entire panorama** — the peak of density, warmth, and atmospheric pressure — defining the visual and physical ceiling for all other tiles. Reject any framing that widens FOV or lowers apparent tower height versus Tiles 3 and 7.

> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
