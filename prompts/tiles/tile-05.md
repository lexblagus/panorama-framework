# Tile 5: Locked prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented image of the **iconic urban core** of a vast megacity at **golden hour**, captured from a fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**. The city appears monumentally dense, vertically stacked, and compressed toward the horizon.
> 
> A **single, perfectly vertical primary urban axis** dominates the composition, running from the bottom of the frame toward the distant skyline. This axis acts as the gravitational spine of the city. All other circulation elements remain subordinate and partially obscured.
> 
> **Layered infrastructure aligns with this axis**: a grand avenue at street level, rail or subway corridors below, and occasional elevated infrastructure above. Rail lines run vertically or near-vertically and may enter or exit **tunnels**, with trains appearing only in **partial segments**. The **rail corridor defines scale**, not the train itself.
> 
> **All vehicles respect strict human-scale proportions.** Train cars are long but low-profile, approximately two times the height of nearby cars or buses, never visually dominant. Scale is conveyed through **length, repetition, layering, and occlusion**, not bulk.
> 
> The skyline reaches its **maximum vertical intensity** here, with dense clusters of tall towers. Architectural variety is intentionally heterogeneous: modern glass slabs, stepped art-deco silhouettes, neo-gothic verticals, brutalist concrete masses, and dense mid-rise blocks coexist. Buildings differ in age, material, façade rhythm, and roofline geometry. Architectural relatives, not twins.
> 
> **A partially visible solar disk is allowed only here.** If visible, it must be **fully diffused through haze with no hard edge**, and may be partially occluded by skyline or clouds or cropped by the frame. It may also be fully obscured. Scale is conveyed through **light pressure and atmospheric brightness**, never a crisp solar boundary.
>
> Lighting behavior is **centered / frontal diffusion**, producing maximum atmospheric bloom without harsh side-cast contrast.
> 
> **Contrast follows depth.** Foreground elements retain higher local contrast, sharper edges, and clearer material definition. Contrast and clarity decrease progressively with distance: midground softens under warm haze, and background dissolves into amber atmospheric diffusion near the horizon.
> 
> Surfaces show subtle wear and imperfection: aging concrete, weathered stone, uneven glass reflections, rooftop clutter. No hyper-clean finishes, no artificial polish, no crystalline artifacts.
> 
> Traffic flows densely along the central axis, forming luminous threads of movement without excessive motion blur. Life is present but subordinated to architectural mass and infrastructure scale.
> 
> The image must read as the **equilibrium point of the entire panorama** — the peak of density, warmth, and atmospheric pressure — defining the visual and physical ceiling for all other tiles.
> 
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
