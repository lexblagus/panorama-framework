# Generator Prompt (Provisional — Pass-3b applied)

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented image depicting the **urban transition zone** of a vast megacity during **golden hour**, captured from a fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system.
> 
> This tile represents the **shift from dense residential fabric toward mixed-use urban complexity**. Building height and typology diversify: taller residential blocks and early office buildings appear, but no skyline silhouette dominates. Verticality is emerging, not iconic.
> 
> Midground density is increased through **layered overlap and occlusion**. Buildings partially block one another across depth, with frequent foreground-to-midground interference. Streets, overpasses, and building volumes introduce a **diagonal reading from bottom-right to top-left**, reducing perceived openness without increasing building height. Sky exposure is limited by overlapping structures rather than taller towers.
> 
> Circulation becomes layered and negotiated. Roads curve and overlap, with ramps, overpasses, and partial interchanges introducing multi-level movement without forming a central axis.
> 
> Transit infrastructure begins to surface: subway entrances, cut-and-cover tunnels, and short elevated segments appear as coordinated systems rather than isolated insertions. Rail elements remain partially obscured and scale-respectful.
> 
> Far-background depth is increased through **compressed urban layers beyond the midground**. Distant building silhouettes and infrastructural mass repeat and soften progressively, dissolving into atmospheric haze rather than terminating at a clear skyline edge. The visual horizon aligns perceptually with the core tile, remaining continuous but lower and less defined.
> 
> **Vertical density decreases progressively toward the upper third of the frame.** Urban mass thins as elevation rises: upper portions of buildings soften, fragment, and dissolve into haze rather than forming a continuous vertical wall. The highest visible structures release earlier than in the core tile, creating perceptual breathing room above the midground without increasing visible sky or lowering building height.
> 
> Atmosphere shows the **first clear warm-up** in the lateral gradient. Early amber tones tint façades and streets. A light haze softens midground distance while intensifying upward dissolution. The sun itself is not visible.
> 
> Architecture is mixed-era and heterogeneous: concrete residential blocks, aging mid-rises, early glass office slabs, and scattered commercial structures. No repeated façade rhythm, no landmark forms.
> 
> Traffic density increases, with cars, buses, and occasional trams reinforcing scale and movement. Vehicles remain human-scale and partially occluded.
> 
> The image must clearly read as **between** the residential density of Tile 2 and the vertical pressure of Tile 4 — a zone of transition, complexity, and anticipation.
> 
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
