> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image depicting a **dense urban transition zone with interwoven green urbanism** during **golden hour**, captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system.
> 
> This scene represents a **human-scaled yet dense city fabric** positioned between natural dominance and cosmopolitan intensity. Buildings are predominantly **low- to mid-rise**, tightly packed, heterogeneous, and utilitarian. No skyline or iconic vertical forms are present.
> 
> Urban form is **mixed and lived-in**. Mid-rise apartment blocks coexist with smaller residential houses and older buildings of varied eras. Density is achieved through **accumulation, overlap, and repetition**, not height.
> 
> Green elements are **woven directly into the city**. A **canalized stream or river remnant** passes through the district in a concrete channel with softened, vegetated edges. Trees and weedy vegetation follow rail lines, roads, and embankments. **Pocket parks and courtyards** appear irregularly between blocks.
> 
> Circulation is layered and human-scale. **Pedestrian stairways, footbridges, and small overpasses** connect uneven streets and infrastructure layers. At street level, **small market strips, corner shops, kiosks, and neighborhood commerce** cluster along busy routes.
> 
> Transit infrastructure is embedded and non-monumental. **Small subway station entrances** and short elevated rail segments appear intermittently, integrated into daily life.
> 
> Rooftops show signs of habitation: **water tanks, laundry lines, satellite dishes, and small rooftop structures**, reinforcing human scale.
> 
> The far background resolves into continuous low- to mid-rise urban spread, gradually dissolving into warm atmospheric haze. The horizon is distant, indistinct, and non-iconic.
> 
> Light is warm and diffuse. The sun is off-frame. Golden haze compresses distance without dramatizing scale.
> 
> Traffic density is moderate to high. Cars, buses, and trams are numerous and clearly readable, acting as primary scale references.
> 
> The image must read as a **crowded, green-interwoven, human-scaled urban continuum**, clearly positioned between the natural chaos of Tile 1 and the cosmopolitan vertical pressure of Tile 5.
> 
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
