# Tile 3: Generator prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image depicting a **dense urban transition zone with interwoven green urbanism** during **golden hour**, captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system. Broad city coverage, compressed distance, no wide-angle distortion.
>
> This scene represents a **human-scaled yet dense city fabric** positioned between natural dominance and cosmopolitan intensity. Buildings are predominantly **low- to mid-rise**, tightly packed, heterogeneous, and utilitarian. No skyline or iconic vertical forms are present; density is achieved through **accumulation, overlap, and repetition**, not height.
>
> Green elements are **woven directly into the city**. A **canalized stream or river remnant** passes through the district in a concrete channel with softened, vegetated edges. Trees and weedy vegetation follow infrastructure lines; pocket parks and courtyards appear irregularly and remain secondary.
>
> Circulation is layered and human-scale: pedestrian stairways, footbridges, small overpasses, embedded transit entrances, short elevated rail segments, and neighborhood commerce (market strips, kiosks, corner shops). Rooftops show habitation: water tanks, laundry lines, satellite dishes, and small rooftop structures.
>
> **Three-band framing lock (Tile 5 referenced):** lower Band A slightly to allow **~24–30% sky** while keeping the shared vanishing logic. Prevent “zoomed-in” reads: no single near-foreground block/road fills the bottom; prefer midground stacking, overlap, and occlusion. Roof-field/crest sits below the expanded sky band; do not introduce a distant high-rise skyline silhouette.
>
> Light is warm and diffuse, coming from the **right side, off-frame**. The sun is off-frame. Primary cast shadows fall to the **left**. The district’s massing and circulation show a **subtle diagonal tendency (bottom-right → top-left)** without forming a single dominant axial spine.
>
> Traffic density is moderate to high. Cars, buses, and trams are numerous and clearly readable as primary scale references.
>
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
