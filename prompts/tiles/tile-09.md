> REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED (upload order):
> - Reference A (RULER / CAMERA AUTHORITY): Tile 5 (005-02-tile5.png)
> 
> USE POLICY:
> - Reference A controls ONLY: camera altitude feel, camera pitch, rectilinear telephoto compression feel, vertical “pressure”, and sky-budget discipline (do not open sky).
> - Do NOT copy Tile 5 content: no midtown skyline motifs, no landmark silhouettes, no central-axis identity, no sun disk.
> 
> OUTPUT
> - Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
> 
> GENERATOR PROMPT
> Generate Tile 9 (Heavy Industrial Expanse / Terminus). Photorealistic.
> Late golden hour daylight (still bright; no dusk/night).
> 
> CAMERA (MUST MATCH TILE 5)
> - High elevated aerial viewpoint (same altitude feel as Reference A).
> - Slight downward pitch like Reference A (not near-ground, not drone-close).
> - Rectilinear optics with strong telephoto-like compression (no wide-angle drift).
> - No vertical recentering to “fit” subjects; do not add extra sky. Cropping/clipping is allowed.
> - Avoid near-field dominance: no single bottom-foreground slab/roof taking over the frame.
> 
> SUBJECT (TILE 9)
> Ultra-dense heavy industry dissolving into smog: petrochemical complexes, refineries, stacks, cranes, container yards, railyards, pipelines, conveyors, warehouses, power/utility infrastructure. Density via layered repetition into depth (multiple corridors and stacked slabs), not a single hero object.
> 
> ENGINEERED SHORELINE (REQUIRED)
> The land–water boundary must read artificial/industrial: straight, angular, faceted docks/harbors/seawalls/containment geometry. No organic coastline. Introduce a strong diagonal or faceted shoreline cut.
> 
> WATER + SHIPPING
> Include a navigable industrial channel/basin with at least one large cargo ship/tanker and realistic dock infrastructure. Ships are utilitarian and correctly scaled.
> 
> ATMOSPHERE (MAXIMUM HAZE)
> Maximum haze of the panorama: far background nearly erased into milky smog; skyline edges not crisp. Palette trends bluish-gray / desaturated industrial tones. Subtle diffuse industrial radiance inside haze is allowed (soft only; no contrast boost).
> 
> LIGHTING + WIND
> Key light from the left; shadows fall to the right. Wind blows to the right.
> Smoke/steam is OPTIONAL. If present, it must be subtle/low-contrast and drift right immediately (no left-trailing plumes). If unsure, omit distinct plumes and let emissions read as diffuse particulate within the haze canopy. Sun is prohibited (no solar disk).
> 
> FORBIDDEN
> Natural shoreline, pastoral greenery/nature dominance, residential neighborhood identity (grids, boulevards, recognizable “city” streets), landmark towers/buildings, crisp skyline edges, fantasy/sci-fi motifs.

## NanoBanana compiled prompt

To generate tile 9 in NanoBanana without references:

> You are generating a photorealistic image as part of a large, multi-tile panoramic cityscape.
> This image must behave as one tile in a continuous photographic system.
> 
> OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
> - Output size: exactly 768×1408 pixels (portrait). Do not return any other size.
> - If exact pixels are not possible, keep the aspect ratio strictly portrait and choose the closest size to 768×1408.
> 
> RULES
> - Do not reinterpret the scene creatively.
> - Do not add landmarks, symbols, or narrative elements that are not explicitly implied.
> - Preserve scale realism, camera consistency, and atmospheric logic.
> - If multiple interpretations are possible, choose continuity, not novelty.
> 
> Generate Tile 9 (Heavy Industrial Expanse / Terminus). Photorealistic.
> Fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression (no wide-angle drift). Narrow field of view. Infrastructure density is ultra high.
> 
> SUBJECT
> Heavy industry dissolving into smog: factories, petrochemical complexes, chimneys, cranes, railyards, cargo lines, heavy machinery, and large cargo ships. The heaviest infrastructure biases toward the center and right half of the frame. Emphasize layered repetition into depth (multiple rail corridors, yards, pipes, stacked industrial slabs), not one giant foreground object.
> 
> ENGINEERED SHORELINE (REQUIRED)
> The land–water boundary must read as artificial and industrial: straight, angular, faceted, formed by docks/harbors/containment structures.
> No organic, eroded, natural coastline. Shoreline geometry introduces a strong diagonal or faceted cut that contrasts with lateral flow.
> 
> ATMOSPHERE (MAXIMUM HAZE)
> This tile has the maximum haze of the entire panorama. Visibility collapses: far background nearly erased into milky smog; skyline edges are not crisp.
> Haze may glow softly with diffuse industrial radiance, but must NOT increase contrast or warmth.
> Overall palette trends bluish-gray / desaturated with soft volumetric radiance.
> 
> LIGHTING + MOTION
> Key light comes from the left. Primary cast shadows fall to the right.
> Wind direction to the right (chimney smoke/steam trails drift right).
> Sun is prohibited (no solar disk).
> 
> FORBIDDEN
> Nature dominance, residential streets, landmark buildings, crisp skyline edges, fantasy/sci-fi motifs.
