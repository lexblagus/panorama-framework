# Tile 9 prompts

## Header

Prepend this if you have reference images:
- A ruler image: a previous estabilized tile 5
- A mood image: a artistic reference

> REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED:
> - Reference A: Tile 5 (ruler): `tile5ruler.png`
> - Reference B: Tile 9 mood image (palette/atmosphere only): `tile9mood.png`
> 
> USE POLICY (priority order):
> - Reference A controls framing physics: horizon/vanishing height feel, sky-budget discipline, telephoto compression, and scale normalization.
> - Reference B controls ONLY mood: haze character, industrial density feeling, and filmic tonal response.
> - Do NOT copy composition from Reference B (no skyline/shoreline layout copying, no distinctive silhouettes, no repeating patterns).
> - Time-of-day lock: still bright golden-hour daylight (no dusk/night). Artificial lights, if present, must be sparse, utilitarian, and subdued—not city-at-night sparkle.
> - If any conflict exists between references, follow Reference A and the written spec.

## Provisional/anchored prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented image of the **outer industrial extreme** of the megacity at **late golden hour daylight (still bright; no dusk)**, captured from a fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**. The city feels heavy, flattened, and utilitarian, with vast distances compressed into dense layers of industrial infrastructure.
>
> The composition’s dominant read is **horizontal**: logistics sprawl, rail and road corridors, and industrial mass spread laterally across the frame. Any residual vertical ordering is weak and fragmented — there is no clear primary vertical urban spine.
>
> **Industrial systems dominate**: extensive rail yards, freight corridors, container terminals, ports, refineries, petrochemical plants, power stations, cooling towers, smokestacks, silos, pipelines, conveyors, warehouses, and heavy logistics facilities. Rail infrastructure is layered and continuous, with freight trains long and low-profile, appearing in partial segments, entering/exiting tunnels, passing beneath overpasses, or dissolving into haze. Rail defines scale through repetition and depth, never through bulk.
>
> Architecture is functional and unsentimental: concrete industrial blocks, steel frameworks, storage facilities, worker housing, logistics hubs. High-rise towers are rare, distant, and subordinate. Density is expressed through sprawl, layering, and system repetition rather than vertical monumentality.
>
> An **engineered industrial shoreline is required**. The land–water boundary must read as predominantly straight, angular, and artificial, formed by docks, harbors, seawalls, containment structures, and port geometry. Organic or eroded coastlines are not allowed. The boundary should introduce a strong diagonal or faceted geometry that cuts across the frame and contrasts with the panorama’s lateral flow.
>
> **Framing stability (Tile 5 as ruler, no bands):** align with Tile 5’s vanishing-height feel; when the true horizon is erased by smog, use rail/road/roof-field vanishing height as the proxy. Never vertically recenter—crop/clip if smokestacks press the frame. If sky feels too open, add industrial mass or haze inside the same framing. Prevent push-in reads by avoiding a single foreground yard/track fan and reinforcing layered repetition into depth.
>
> The **dominant light pressure originates from the far left edge of the frame**, fully off-image. The sun itself is not visible. Primary cast shadows fall to the **right**. Residual warmth remains on the sunward side, while the rest of the image cools into desaturated browns, grays, steel tones, and polluted blues.
>
> **Maximum haze mandate:** atmosphere is extremely thick and oppressive, filled with smoke, steam, dust, and particulate matter. Visibility collapses: the far background should be nearly erased into milky smog; skyline edges must not be crisp. Diffuse industrial glow interacts with fog and smog, producing soft volumetric radiance **without increasing contrast or warmth**.
>
> Wind blows **to the right**, and smoke/steam plumes from chimneys consistently drift rightward.
>
> Industrial safety elements may be visible: aviation beacons, hazard lights, navigation signals, warning lamps, and sparse functional illumination across infrastructure (utilitarian, subdued, patterned—never decorative).
>
> Surfaces show heavy wear and age: rust, grime, oil stains, soot accumulation, peeling paint, patched concrete, weathered steel. Human presence is minimal and incidental. Movement feels slow, heavy, continuous.
>
> Tile 9 represents the **industrial terminus of the panorama** — exhausted, mechanical, and oppressive — while remaining part of the same continuous megacity system.
>
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
