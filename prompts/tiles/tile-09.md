# Tile 9 prompts

## ChatGPT provisional/anchored prompt

***Upload*** the tile 5 deviation image reference and then:

> REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED (upload order):
> - Reference A (RULER / CAMERA + ATMOSPHERE + LIGHT-ACCENT LANGUAGE): Tile 5 deviation reference (hard haze + subtle light accents)
> 
> USE POLICY:
> - Reference A controls ONLY:
>   - camera altitude feel, camera pitch, rectilinear telephoto compression feel, vertical “pressure”, sky-budget discipline (do not open sky)
>   - haze physics (milky white–bluish gray diffusion) and how small lights bloom through haze
> - Do NOT copy any Tile 5 content: no skyline motifs, no landmark silhouettes, no central-axis identity, no sun disk.
> 
> OUTPUT
> - Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
> 
> GENERATOR PROMPT
> Generate Tile 9 (Heavy Industrial Expanse / Terminus). Photorealistic.
> 
> CAMERA (MUST MATCH REFERENCE A)
> - High elevated aerial viewpoint (same altitude feel as Reference A).
> - Slight downward pitch like Reference A (not near-ground, not drone-close).
> - Rectilinear optics with strong telephoto-like compression (no wide-angle drift).
> - No vertical recentering to “fit” subjects; do not add extra sky. Cropping/clipping is allowed.
> - Avoid near-field dominance: no single bottom-foreground slab/roof taking over the frame.
> 
> SUBJECT (TILE 9)
> Ultra-dense heavy industry dissolving into smog: petrochemical complexes, refineries, stacks, cranes, container yards, railyards, pipelines, conveyors, warehouses, power/utility infrastructure.
> Density via layered repetition into depth (multiple corridors and stacked slabs), not a single hero object.
> 
> ENGINEERED SHORELINE (REQUIRED)
> The land–water boundary must read artificial/industrial: straight, angular, faceted docks/harbors/seawalls/containment geometry. No organic coastline.
> Introduce a strong diagonal or faceted shoreline cut.
> 
> WATER + SHIPPING
> Include a navigable industrial channel/basin with realistic dock/port infrastructure (quays, piers, mooring zones, cranes).
> Include at least one utilitarian cargo ship or tanker (correct scale, not heroic).
> 
> ATMOSPHERE (HARD HAZE — MATCH REFERENCE A)
> - EXTREME white–bluish gray industrial haze/smog canopy (very heavy).
> - Distance collapse is severe: far background nearly erased (ghost silhouettes only).
> - Upper half and deep distance are thick milky diffusion; midground remains readable (soft edges, reduced contrast).
> - Global palette: cold blue-gray / polluted steel tones; desaturated.
> - If unsure: ADD MORE HAZE — but do not become a blank white fog card.
> 
> LIGHTING + WIND (DAYTIME / SLIGHT DUSK OK)
> - Keep overall illumination as daytime (not night). Slight duskiness is acceptable.
> - No visible sun disk.
> - Key light from the left; shadows fall to the right. Wind biases to the right.
> - Smoke/steam is OPTIONAL. If present, keep it subtle/low-contrast and drifting right immediately (no dramatic plumes).
> 
> LIGHT ACCENTS (REQUIRED, SUBTLE — LIKE REFERENCE A)
> - Add sparse utilitarian industrial lighting visible THROUGH haze:
>   - dock/yard floodlights, gantry/port work lights, small perimeter lights
>   - occasional dim obstruction beacons on tall stacks (very subtle red dots)
>   - optional ship navigation/work lights (tiny, realistic)
> - Optional tiny window glows in industrial admin blocks only (not “city” buildings).
> - Optional faint vehicle lights if roads/yard traffic are visible (subdued red tails, subdued headlights).
> Rules:
> - Lights must be low-intensity, diffused by haze, and NOT “city sparkle” or nightlife.
> - Keep count modest: a few clusters and scattered points, not a glitter field.
> 
> FORBIDDEN
> Natural shoreline, pastoral greenery/nature dominance, residential neighborhood identity (recognizable city streets/grids), landmark towers/buildings, crisp skyline edges, fantasy/sci-fi motifs.

## NanoBanana compiled prompt

To generate tile 9 in NanoBanana without references:

> You are generating a photorealistic image as part of a large, multi-tile panoramic cityscape.
> This image must behave as one tile in a continuous photographic system.
> 
> Do not reinterpret the scene creatively.
> Do not add landmarks, symbols, or narrative elements that are not explicitly implied.
> Preserve scale realism, camera consistency, and atmospheric logic.
> If multiple interpretations are possible, choose continuity, not novelty.
> 
> OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
> - Output size: exactly 768×1408 pixels (portrait). Do not return any other size.
> - If exact pixels are not possible, keep the aspect ratio strictly portrait and choose the closest size to 768×1408.
> 
> If a reference image is provided: match its camera altitude/pitch, rectilinear telephoto compression, haze thickness/physics, and how small lights bloom through haze. Do NOT copy its content.
> 
> Generate Tile 9 (Heavy Industrial Expanse / Terminus). Photorealistic.
> Fixed elevated aerial viewpoint, slight downward pitch, rectilinear optics with strong telephoto-like depth compression (no wide-angle). Narrow field of view; do not open the sky.
> 
> Scene: ultra-dense heavy industry dissolving into smog—refineries/petrochemical plants, stacks, cranes, container yards, railyards, pipelines, conveyors, warehouses, power infrastructure. Density is expressed by layered repetition into depth (multiple corridors and stacked slabs), not a single hero object.
> 
> Engineered shoreline REQUIRED: straight/angular artificial docks, seawalls, containment geometry forming a strong diagonal/faceted cut.
> Include a navigable industrial basin/channel with realistic port infrastructure and at least one utilitarian cargo ship or tanker (correct scale, not heroic).
> 
> Atmosphere = maximum haze of the panorama: EXTREME milky white–blue-gray industrial smog canopy. Distance collapse is severe; far background is nearly erased (ghost silhouettes only). Midground remains barely readable with soft edges (no full whiteout). Palette: cold blue-gray / polluted steel tones, desaturated.
> 
> Lighting + wind: cool daytime illumination. No visible sun disk. Key light from the left; shadows fall to the right. Wind to the right; any smoke/steam is subtle/low-contrast and drifts right immediately.
> 
> Light accents: sparse utilitarian industrial lights visible through haze (dock/yard work lights, occasional dim obstruction beacons, tiny ship work/navigation lights). Low intensity, fog-bloomed, not a glitter field.
> 
> Avoid: natural/organic coastline, pastoral greenery dominance, residential city identity, crisp skyline edges, sci-fi/fantasy motifs.
