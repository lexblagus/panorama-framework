# Anchored prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented image depicting the post-core urban sprawl of a vast megacity during golden hour, captured from a fixed elevated aerial viewpoint with rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system.
> 
> This tile represents the release of vertical pressure after the central core. Building heights reduce noticeably, but density remains high. The city spreads laterally through crowded mid-rise fabric rather than stacking upward.
> 
> Architecture is mixed-era and visually cluttered: aging residential blocks, commercial slabs, older office buildings, and opportunistic infill coexist without iconic identity. No skyline silhouette dominates; the horizon fragments and dissolves into haze.
> 
> Circulation becomes broad and directional. Roads widen, intersections grow complex, and overpasses overlap. Movement feels logistical and continuous rather than axial. Early service trucks and delivery vehicles appear among dense civilian traffic.
> 
> Infrastructure shows age and adaptation: patched concrete, exposed utilities, rooftop equipment, signage clutter, and retrofitted structures. Systems feel stressed but functional.
> 
> Atmosphere continues the lateral gradient away from the core. Warmth fades, colors desaturate, and haze thickens, softening distance and dissolving the skyline. Foreground remains readable; background blends into atmospheric mass.
> 
> Light comes from the left, filtered through haze. The sun is not visible.
> 
> Tile 7 must clearly read as less vertical than Tile 6, denser than Tile 8, and part of the same continuous megacity system.
> 
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
