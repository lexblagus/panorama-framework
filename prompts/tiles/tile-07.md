# Tile 7 prompts

## Header

Prepend this if you have a reference image (a previous estabilized tile 5)

> REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED:
> - Reference A: Tile 5 (ruler): `tile5ruler.png`
> 
> USE POLICY (strict):
> - Use Reference A ONLY to match: camera/framing physics (horizon/vanishing height feel), sky-budget discipline (no extra sky), telephoto compression feel, and midground scale.
> - Do NOT import any urban-core content from Reference A: no skyscrapers, no central axis, no dense grid logic.
> - This tile must remain nature-dominant; Reference A is a ruler, not content.

## Generator prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image depicting a **late-stage urban district transitioning toward logistics and service dominance**, captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system. Broad coverage, compressed distance, no wide-angle distortion.
>
> This is **not suburbia** and not a residential neighborhood. The city supports a large resident population, but residential life is increasingly compressed and subordinated to circulation, commerce, and utility systems. The urban fabric feels older, heavier, and throughput-driven rather than comfortable or master-planned.
>
> Density is expressed through **large footprints, repeated masses, and infrastructure layering**. Predominantly low-rise to mid-rise construction. Large repetitive **working-class residential blocks** interwoven with infrastructure corridors. Low-rise commercial slabs, warehouses, depots, service yards, and utility installations appear throughout.
>
> Circulation is multi-level and complex: broad load-bearing roads, layered intersections, ramps, partial interchanges, underpasses, and occasional tunnel entrances. Early logistics and service traffic is visible: rigid multi-axle trucks, urban cargo vehicles, articulated trucks and semi-trailers (present but not dominant), fuel/gas tanker trucks, cab-over and non-cab-over configurations, and canvas-tarp truck bodies in muted orange and brown tones (new and weathered).
>
> **Three-band framing lock (Tile 5 referenced):** keep the vanishing height aligned while allowing a **larger sky band (~24–30%)**; crest sits below that band. Prevent push-in reads: avoid a single near-foreground interchange filling the bottom; roads may dominate, but must remain telephoto-compressed and not close-up. Prefer midground stacking and overlap of residential slabs + warehouses + service yards to create density.
>
> Dominant spatial energy reads as a **diagonal post-core release (bottom-left → top-right)** without cinematic tilt. No single heroic diagonal spine; express the diagonal through layered massing and circulation tendency.
>
> The **dominant light pressure originates from the far left edge of the frame**, fully off-image. The sun is not visible. Primary cast shadows fall to the **right**. Brightest haze/sky pressure sits on the **left** side, cooling and desaturating toward the right.
>
> Atmosphere is hazier and more desaturated than Tile 5, but not as fully suffocating as Tile 9. The tile must read as the threshold where logistics begins to overtake residential order.
>
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
