# Tile 7: Generator Prompt

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image of a **late-stage urban district transitioning toward logistics and commerce**, captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system.
> 
> The scene depicts a **heavy, aging city fabric** shaped by circulation, service, and logistics, while supporting a **large resident population**. This is **not suburbia** and not a residential neighborhood; residential density exists at **block scale**, not at human scale.
> 
> **Large residential blocks** form a significant portion of the urban mass. These are **extensive, repetitive housing structures** with large footprints, clustered and repeated across the scene. They are utilitarian, working-class in character, and non-iconic, functioning as **demographic containers** rather than architectural statements.
> 
> Residential blocks are **interwoven with infrastructure**. Roads, ramps, and service corridors cut through and around housing clusters. Buildings wrap around circulation and utilities, reinforcing coexistence and spatial pressure rather than comfort or dominance.
> 
> Urban scale is driven by **logistics and service activity**, expressed through **vehicle diversity rather than uniform volume**. A heterogeneous mix of vehicles appears irregularly:
> - rigid multi-axle trucks,
> - urban cargo vehicles,
> - articulated trucks and semi-trailers (present but not dominant),
> - fuel and gas tanker trucks of varied shapes and colors,
> - both cab-over and non-cab-over configurations.
> Truck bodies include **canvas tarps in muted orange and brown tones**, some new and some weathered.
> 
> Commercial architecture expands laterally. **Low-rise commercial slabs, warehouses, and service buildings** with large footprints occupy major zones of the frame, visually competing with residential mass rather than replacing it.
> 
> **Circulation is multi-layered and spatially continuous across depth.**  
>
> Dominant spatial energy is **diagonal (post-core release)**: the largest circulation corridors and massing should subtly lean **bottom-left → top-right** as a release from Tile 5’s vertical spine, without forming a single heroic axis.
>
> Surface roads coexist with **elevated roadways, flyovers, ramps, and partial interchanges**, with occasional tunnel entrances and underpasses. Circulation elements repeat from foreground to background, overlapping residential and commercial structures and extending the spatial read into the distance.
> 
> Major roads show **clear visual cues of directionality**, such as lane markings, medians, or physical separation between traffic directions, while remaining stitch-safe at the image edges.
> 
> City utilities are visibly integrated. **Gas and water backbone infrastructure** runs alongside roads and through residential and commercial areas via pipelines, service corridors, and utility installations.
> 
> Pedestrian presence is minimal and secondary. Human life is implied through population mass, habitation scale, logistics flow, and utility systems.
> 
> The far background resolves into extended urban mass under atmospheric haze. No skyline forms. No industrial megastructures appear. **Full industrial systems remain absent**, but the city’s scale and population density are unmistakable.
> 
> Light is warm but muted, coming from the **left side, off-frame**, filtered through haze. Late golden hour tones remain present but progressively desaturate toward the industrial periphery.
> 
> The image must read as a **population-heavy, logistics-pressured urban threshold**, positioned between the urban core and the industrial periphery.
> 
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
