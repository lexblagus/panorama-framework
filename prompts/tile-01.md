# Tile 1 Prompts

## Header

Prepend this if you have a reference image (a previous estabilized tile 5)

> REFERENCE IMAGES PROVIDED:
> - Reference A: Tile 5 (ruler): `tile5ruler.png`
> 
> USE POLICY (strict):
> - Use Reference A ONLY to match: camera/framing physics (horizon/vanishing height feel), sky-budget discipline (no extra sky), telephoto compression feel, and midground scale.
> - Do NOT import any urban-core content from Reference A: no skyscrapers, no central axis, no dense grid logic.
> - This tile must remain nature-dominant; Reference A is a ruler, not content.

> Photorealistic portrait-oriented aerial image depicting the **natural extreme** of the panorama: steep mountains, cliffs, rugged terrain, and a deep valley carved by a river or reservoir. Captured from a fixed elevated viewpoint with **rectilinear optics and strong telephoto-like depth compression**, consistent with the panorama’s unified camera system. Broad coverage, compressed distance, no wide-angle distortion.
>
> Nature is **dominant, energetic, and resistant**, not pastoral. Exposed rock faces, sharp elevation drops, dense irregular vegetation, and turbulent water behavior (cascades, stepped flow, waterfalls, spillways, or a dam integrated into terrain) define the scene.
>
> Human presence exists only as **negotiated proto-infrastructure**: carved mountain roads, switchbacks, tunnels, viaducts, cliffside cuts, retaining walls, and small access structures. Settlements are sparse but legible in **layered pockets**: hillside dwellings, terraces, and scattered slope villages embedded into the terrain (vernacular houses, stone dwellings, occasional brutalist or modern hillside villas). Optional subtle passenger rail may appear as a constrained corridor or tunnel segment, strictly subordinate.
>
> **Framing stability (Tile 5 as ruler, no bands):** keep Tile 5’s telephoto framing pressure; do not vertically recenter to fit peaks or sun—crop/clip instead. If sky feels too open, add terrain bulk, roof-field density, or haze inside the same framing. Prevent push-in reads by reducing any single foreground mass and adding midground stacking/overlap of settlements and infrastructure.
>
> The **dominant light pressure originates from the far right edge of the frame**, fully off-image. The sun is not visible. Primary cast shadows fall to the **left**. Air is clear and crisp relative to later tiles, with strong material definition and minimal haze.
>
> No skyline, no metropolitan order, no urban grids or major avenues. The scene must read as **nature overwhelming human systems**, forming the leftmost anchor of the panorama.
>
> Output: 1024 × 1536, portrait orientation.
