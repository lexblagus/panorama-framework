> Photorealistic ultra-wide megacity panorama captured during **golden hour**, late afternoon approaching early sunset, viewed from a **fixed elevated aerial perspective** at realistic drone or rooftop height. Broad city coverage rendered with **rectilinear optics and telephoto-like depth compression**, producing dense stacking of buildings and visually compressed distances. No fisheye, no barrel distortion, and no exaggerated wide-angle perspective. Horizon physics, camera height, pitch, and framing are consistent and immutable across all images.
> 
> The panorama follows a **strictly monotonic lateral ambiance gradient from left to right**, encoded through lighting behavior, color temperature, atmospheric density, diffusion, and contrast. This gradient evolves progressively from Tile 1 to Tile 9 and must **never reverse, oscillate, or locally reset**.
> 
> Warm golden-hour daylight dominates the entire scene. The panorama remains bright; no night lighting or dusk conditions are allowed. Long shadows are present and consistent with sun position. Atmospheric haze increases with depth (foreground → background), while overall fog, smog, and particulate density increase cumulatively along the lateral axis toward the right. Skyline elements progressively dissolve into haze, especially in later tiles.
> 
> Color behavior is **laterally bound to tile position**. Warmth, chromatic saturation, and local contrast increase progressively toward the center of the panorama and decrease progressively afterward. **After the central peak, warmth, saturation, and contrast must not reappear or locally intensify**, even in foreground elements.
> 
> The urban environment is highly realistic and continuous, composed of dense mixed-era architecture in quantity and variation rather than isolated landmarks. Building typologies include modern glass towers of varied heights, dense mid-rise residential blocks, brutalist concrete structures, and historic gothic, neo-gothic, and art-deco commercial buildings. No sci-fi or fantasy elements are permitted.
> 
> Surfaces exhibit subtle wear and imperfection: dirt, stains, uneven coloration, and aging materials. Avoid hyper-polished surfaces, artificial cleanliness, or crystalline “AI” artifacts. Natural photographic sharpness is required, with high micro-contrast on building edges, a sharp midground, softened far distance, and slight sensor noise (not painterly grain).
> 
> Vehicles appear at realistic scale and mixed eras, with traffic density varying naturally by tile. The entire panorama must read as **one continuous city captured in a single coherent photographic moment**.

For **Central Master Reference Image** generation, add:

> Iconic central urban core at peak vertical density, representing the maximum architectural intensity of the entire panorama. This image defines the architectural DNA, density logic, lighting peak, and atmospheric maximum for all subsequent tiles.
> 
> Lighting is centered and frontal, producing maximum atmospheric diffusion without harsh contrast. Maximum warmth, chromatic richness, and volumetric haze occur here relative to all other tiles.
> 
> The solar disk may be partially visible **only in this image**, fully diffused through haze with no hard edge. Its scale may exceed realistic proportions and may be partially cropped by the frame, reading as an atmospheric phenomenon rather than a literal sun.
